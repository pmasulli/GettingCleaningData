Analyze and Tidy the Samsung Data 
========================================================

## How to use the script
The script run_analysis.R performs the required analysis of the data set and transforms ti to create a tidy data set that is saved to a CSV file called tidyData.csv.
It also creates a separate data file called averageData.csv that contains, for each of the 30 subjects and for each of the 6 activities, an average of the observations.

## What does the script do?
Please see the code book, CodeBook.md for details about what the script does to clean and tidy up the data.
